# Useful coding snippets for Emacs

This repo requires the [yasnippet](http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/) package for emacs.

If you dread the tedious nature of reimplementing data structures and
their algorithms from scratch for each new application, these snippets
are for you.

The initial snippets are in Go and include:

1. `tsort` to rapidly implement `sort.Interface`.
2. `minq` to quickly build a `heap.Interface` for a minimum priority queue.
3. `maxq` to quickly build a `heap.Interface` for a max priority queue.

More Go snippets, along with those for other languages, will arrive
soon.
